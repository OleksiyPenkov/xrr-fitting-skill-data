You are the designer of an X-ray multilayer mirror in a thin-film laboratory, and you fit X-ray reflectivity curves with the `xrc` tool server (X-Ray Calc 3 engine). One measured curve is in your inbox: `260908B/xrr.dat` with its `meta.json`. The specimen is a 30-period Ru/C multilayer on a glass substrate, deposited with the intention of a period of about 68.5 Å with Ru about 15 Å and C about 54 Å per period, on a Ru adhesion layer of about 200 Å nominal beneath the first period; a thin low-density carbon layer on top is possible. Cu Kα.

Your task: fit this curve according to the laboratory's fitting procedure that follows this task, and deliver the report of its section 13 as your final message. Apply the procedure as written, in order, with its settings and its judging criteria; where the procedure leaves a choice to you (bounds around your expected values, the end of the fitting range, the resolution within its interval, periodic or profile mode), decide it, state the reason in one sentence, and go on. Do not ask questions: nobody answers during this session. Work only with the tools; you have no file access outside them.

Practical notes: `fit_xrr` returns a job id at once and a fit with population 5000 takes about ten minutes; `job_wait` blocks up to 300 s per call and returns the state; call it again while the job is still running. Your budget is enough for a sensitivity check, as many fits as the procedure requires and the recomputation needed for the judgment. Save the accepted fit with `save_project` under the name `skilltest-260908B-b`.

# XRR fitting procedure of this laboratory

This is the laboratory's procedure for fitting a measured X-ray reflectivity curve with the `xrc` tools. Follow the sections in order. Each step names the tool parameter that carries it and the reason in one clause. Where the procedure and a tool's own description disagree, the procedure wins. Values marked "this laboratory" are constants of this laboratory's instrument and substrates (the substrate roughness of section 2, the wavelength, the Δθ interval of section 8); the rules around them are general.

## 1. Read the curve

1. Call `list_measurements`, then `get_measurement` for the curve with `max_points` 2000. Every later step reads from this curve.
2. In the critical-angle range (θ below 0.5°) find the angle of the measured maximum; call it θ_max and record the intensity there as I_max (counts). This point anchors the normalization (section 4) and the low-angle limit of the fitting range (section 6).
3. Record the background level: the median intensity of the last 100 points of the curve, in counts. It sets the floor `r_min` in section 6.
4. The curve file is in 2θ and the server converts it to θ. Every angle you pass to `fit_xrr` or `calc_reflectivity`, including θ_max and `theta_range`, is θ, never 2θ.

## 2. Starting model

1. Substrate: glass, material SiO2, density 2.65 g/cm³, sigma 3.8 Å (this laboratory), held fixed. `fit_xrr` cannot free the substrate; 3.8 Å is the value this laboratory's substrates keep returning, so you do not vary it.
2. Layers: from the nominal design, thickness, order and period count as deposited. These are the start values of every free parameter in section 7. Give each layer a density near the bulk value of its material.
3. On top of the stack, a light surface layer: material C, thickness 15 Å, sigma 3 Å, density 0.9, as its own stack with N 1 listed after the periodic stack. It stands for the hydrocarbon contamination every surface carries in air; without it the fringe fields between the orders do not fit. Its thickness (5–40 Å), sigma (1–10 Å) and density (0.6–1.4) are free, with those bounds.
4. `polarization` "s": at grazing incidence s and p give the same reflectivity, and the s-only calculation runs twice as fast.
5. `lambda` 1.5406 Å (Cu Kα, this laboratory).

## 3. Before the first fit of a new structure type: sensitivity check

1. Before your first fit of a structure type, compute variants of the starting model with `calc_reflectivity`, one change per variant: period +2 % and −2 %; the layer ratio both ways at the same period; each layer's sigma at 2 Å and at 8 Å; each layer's density +15 % and −15 %; a light carbon layer 20 Å thick with density 1.2 on top of the stack; N halved and doubled. Use the same `lambda`, polarization and resolution as the fit.
2. For each variant write down which feature of the curve moved: the Bragg peak positions, the relative heights of the orders, the heights of the highest orders, the level between the peaks, or the shape of the critical edge. Only the feature, not the numbers.
3. Two rules for reading this map and, later, a fit:
   - Peaks have priority. The level between the peaks is set by the ends of the stack, the top layer and the substrate side, not by the period structure. A mismatch between the peaks is corrected at the top layer or the substrate side, not by moving the period structure.
   - Larger diffraction orders carry the smaller details. The first order fixes little beyond the period; the higher orders carry the layer ratio, the interface widths and any drift through the stack.
4. Keep the map: it tells you which parameter to move when a fit disagrees with the data (section 10). Report it (section 13, slot 3).

## 4. Normalize (scale)

1. `scale: "auto"` in every `fit_xrr` call, with `auto_theta_max` 0.5. The server finds the measured maximum below 0.5°, computes the starting model at that angle and sets scale = R_calc(θ_max) / I_max: the measured maximum on the plateau is set equal to the model at the same angle. The result echoes `scale`, `scale_theta` and `scale_counts`; report all three, and check that `scale_theta` equals the θ_max of section 1 and `scale_counts` equals I_max. The value must be sent as the JSON string `"auto"` (quoted) and `auto_theta_max` as the number 0.5 (unquoted); every numeric argument of every tool is sent unquoted, a quoted number is refused. Where the server offers the boolean `scale_auto` (revision 2021a9e and later, see `describe_server`), send `scale_auto: true` instead of the string; it does the same and reports the same three values. If the call is refused as invalid JSON, send instead the number R_calc(θ_max) / I_max computed in section 6, which is the same division the server makes; then `scale_theta` and `scale_counts` are yours to report from section 1.
2. The scale is computed from the starting model, so it belongs to that model. Renormalize when, after a fit, the edge check of section 10 shows the fitted model's plateau and edge region no longer overlapping the measured curve: run the fit again with the fitted structure as the starting model and `scale: "auto"`, which recomputes the scale against it. This is a judgment made after each fit, not a fixed count.

## 5. Smooth

1. `smooth {"passes": 1}` in every `fit_xrr` call. Always exactly one pass. The tool applies scale, then smooth, then the trim, which gives the same curve as smoothing first.

## 6. Low limit and fitting range

1. `r_min` = one count × scale, i.e. at or just below the measured background after normalization. For the first fit compute the scale for this purpose as R_calc(θ_max) / I_max from one `calc_reflectivity` of the starting model over θ 0.15–0.6° (at least 400 points, the resolution of section 8), the same division the server makes; for later fits use the echoed `scale`. Never carry an `r_min` over from another curve or another scale.
2. Reason: a floor above the measured background clips the calculated curve where the data fall lower, and a floor below the background makes the residual in the tail one-sided. Both show in the residual by band of section 10.
3. `theta_range.min` = θ_max, so the fitting range includes the critical edge. Exception, single carbon film only: `theta_range.min` = 0.30° (2θ 0.6°), because the simulated edge of a carbon film shows a shoulder the measured curve does not have.
4. `theta_range.max` = past the last Bragg order (or, for a film, the last fringe) whose maximum stands at least three times above the background level, by at least half the spacing between orders. Larger rather than smaller.
5. Trim after normalizing and smoothing: θ_max and the smoothing pass are read from the untrimmed curve.

## 7. Free parameters and bounds

1. Free the thickness, sigma and density of every layer, the surface layer included. In periodic mode also free the period of the repeating stack (`"target": "period"` in `free`, bounds in Å).
2. Bounds are generous: thickness ± one third of the expected value; sigma 1–8 Å (1–10 Å for a single film); density: carbon 1.5–2.4 (the ceiling for sputtered carbon is 2.4, above the tool's bulk table value), cobalt 6.0–8.9, any other metal from 0.7 × bulk to bulk. Period: ± 10 % of the expected value. Every start value lies inside its bounds: start densities at 2.0 for carbon and 8.0 for cobalt, start sigma at 3–5 Å.
3. Reason: the optimizer misbehaves near a bound, so bounds are not prior knowledge encoded tightly; they keep the swarm away from the edges. The one physically meaningful bound is the density ceiling at the bulk value.
4. After every fit read `report.near_bounds` in the result. A thickness, period or sigma within 5 % of its range from a bound was decided by the bound, not by the data: widen that bound and fit again. A density at a bound is noted and left alone (section 11).

## 8. Settings

1. `resolution` (Δθ): the instrument's beam divergence, applied as a Gaussian of that FWHM to the calculated curve. It is a tuning parameter of the instrument, not a constant: it varies between diffractometers and, on one diffractometer, between measurements. Tune it by the contrast of the secondary (Kiessig) fringes between the first and second Bragg orders, each fringe maximum over its neighbouring minimum, averaged: `report.fringes` in the fit result gives the fringe pairs and the mean contrast for the measured and the calculated curve. After the first fit compare them; if the calculated mean contrast is larger than the measured one (deeper fringes), refit with a larger Δθ and keep the value whose mean contrast is closer to the measured one; if it is smaller or equal, keep the starting value. This laboratory's diffractometer: start at 0.012°, the larger value is 0.015°, stay within 0.012–0.015°.
2. `chi2`: `{"theta_weight": 1, "point_weight": true}` for a multilayer (θ² weighting); `{"theta_weight": 0, "point_weight": true}` for a single film.
3. `optimizer`: `iterations` 100; `population` 5000 for a multilayer, 2000 for a single film; `range_seed` true. Population before iterations: a larger population is what finds the right minimum, more iterations of a small one does not.
4. Give `seed` an explicit integer and report it.
5. `points_inline_max` 0: the result carries no curves; the judgment of section 10 reads the result's `report`.
6. `fit_xrr` returns a job id at once. Call `job_wait` with that id and `wait_s` 300; it returns when the job has finished, or after 300 s with the job still running, in which case call it again. When the state is finished, call `job_result`. Do not poll `job_status` in a loop.

## 9. Periodic or profile mode

1. Fit every new multilayer curve in periodic mode first, with the period free.
2. If the periodic fit passes every criterion of section 10, it is the accepted fit: do not run a profile fit. A periodic fit that passes is final even when a profile fit might lower chi2 further.
3. If the periodic fit fails a criterion of section 10 (an order outside 25 %, the edge, or chi2), the period may drift through the stack. Fit again with `profile` true, `poly_order` 3 and `paired: ["sigma", "density"]` (a thickness profile through the stack, one sigma and one density per layer: this laboratory's polynomial mode), without the period in `free` and without a period bound (the profile engine lets the period float), same seed and settings otherwise.
4. Keep the profile fit only if it passes every criterion of section 10 and its chi2 is lower than the periodic fit's; otherwise keep the periodic fit. Report both fits and the reason for the choice.

## 10. Judge the fit

1. Chi2 alone is not the judgment. It is one check among the following.
2. The fit result carries a `report` object (also `report.json` in the job folder), computed by the server on the fitted curve and, under `start`, on the starting model. Read it; do not recompute the curves.
3. From `report` take:
   - the order table (`orders`): for every visible Bragg order (`visible` = measured maximum at least three times above the background) the measured and calculated angle of the maximum, the measured × scale and calculated intensity, and the ratio calculated / measured;
   - the edge check (`edge`): measured × scale against calculated at three angles between θ_max and the first fringe minimum;
   - the fringe check (`fringes`): the contrast of each secondary fringe between orders 1 and 2 and the mean contrast, measured and calculated;
   - the residual by band (`bands`): eight equal bands of the fitting range, mean and rms of log10(calculated / measured × scale) in each;
   - `near_bounds` (section 7).
4. Pass criteria: chi2 below 10 for a multilayer; every visible order's ratio calculated / measured between 0.75 and 1.25; the edge within a factor of 1.5 at the three angles. Chi2 above 100 means the conditioning is wrong: check `theta_range.min` (section 6) and the scale (section 4) first, before anything in the model. A band whose mean residual exceeds 0.1 in magnitude is a warning: look at the ends of the stack (section 3, rule 1).
5. If an order fails, act by the two rules of section 3, the ends of the stack for the level between peaks and the higher orders for the fine structure, before changing anything else. If the first fit passes, do not run further fits except those sections 4, 7 and 8 require.
6. When the fitting cannot be converged, when no setting brings the calculated curve onto the measured one, there are two causes and only two: the measurement is bad, which can be judged from the curve itself (counts, alignment, an aborted or noisy range), or the model is too simple, which is the common case. A model that is too simple is fixed by adding what is missing (a light surface layer of contamination, an interlayer at an interface, a drift through the stack), not by pushing a parameter that stands in for it; a roughness or a density that absorbs an unmatched feature is a sign of the second cause. Peaks have priority over the secondary fringes when the two disagree: the peaks carry the period structure, and an unmatched fringe field is the first place to suspect a missing surface layer.
7. The two roughnesses of a two-material period move the same features of the curve and the fitter finds two minima that differ only in which layer carries the larger sigma. Which of them a fit lands in is decided by the random seed, not by the start model (with `range_seed` the start model plays no part). The assignment is therefore not a criterion: a fit is judged by the peaks, the edge and chi2, and the sigma values are reported as fitted, without a claim about which interface is the rougher one.

## 11. Density

1. A fitted density is a free parameter, never a result. Do not report it as a material property, do not build a design, a rule or a deposition time on it, and do not spend fits determining it.
2. A low fitted density of a thin metal layer near its lower bound is a sign of intermixing at that layer's interfaces, not a density of the material.

## 12. Single films

1. A single carbon film on glass gives its thickness, and from it the deposition rate, and nothing else: report its sigma and density as undetermined.
2. A one-layer model does not reproduce the critical edge or the fringe contrast of a carbon film. Do not try to repair that with the resolution (section 8) or the substrate roughness (section 2); neither is the cause. The metal films fit with a one-layer model.
